# Getting and Cleaning Data
Coursera R Project for Course 3 in Data Science Specialization

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with and clean up the data set for further modeling and analysis.  

Data Source:  UCI Data Archive  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The analysis of data in this project include: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
